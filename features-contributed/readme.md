#Contributed Firmata Features

This directory 'features-contributed' holds the source files for various features of the Firmata product that are not supported by the main Firmata authors and may be experimental or beta in nature, but are deemed interesting enough to include in the standard Firmata distribution.

The readme.md file in the 'features-optional' companion directory explains how to enable optional and contributed features.
